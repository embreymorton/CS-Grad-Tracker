# What we are doing/thinking of doing TIMELINE

## Feb 12 2020
Discussion/meeting with Bil about the project and data.

- All Student data is FERPA data, but Grades are particularly sensitive.
- For now we should plan on this system being a supplement rather than a replacement to Bil's database.
- Add section in README for what we are trying to achieve, context, etc.
- Ask someone (ITS) to audit code security before going live.
- Make the site only accessible via VPN
- For comments, the beginning should be a description of what is trying to be achieved.
- Bil will be providing us with dummy data, let Denise/Tonja/Missy use it and see if they think it would be a good idea
